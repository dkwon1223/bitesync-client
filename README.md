## üì± Core Components

### Authentication System
- **AuthContext**: Centralized authentication state with JWT management
- **Custom Hooks**: Dedicated hooks for login, logout, and signup operations
- **Protected Routing**: Conditional navigation based on authentication status

### Modal-Based CRUD Operations
```jsx
// Example: Dynamic inventory management
const EditInventoryModal = ({ editing, setEditing, itemId, token, userId }) => {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    name: "", imageUrl: "", quantity: "", unitPrice: 0, category: ""
  });
  
  // Fetch, update, and delete operations with error handling
  const updateInventoryItem = async () => {
    // API communication with authentication headers
  };
};
```

### Advanced Menu Management
- **Ingredient Relationship System**: Connect menu items to required inventory
- **Dynamic Cost Calculation**: Real-time cost-to-make updates based on ingredients
- **Availability Logic**: Automatic menu item availability based on inventory levels

### Comprehensive Order Interface
- **Expandable Order Details**: Collapsible receipt views with itemized breakdowns
- **Status Tracking**: Visual order status indicators with color-coded badges
- **Date/Time Formatting**: Internationalized date and currency formatting

## üéØ Advanced Features

### Dynamic Navigation System
```jsx
// Conditional navigation based on authentication
export const authNavLinks = [
  { label: "Dashboard", route: "/dashboard", icon: dashboardIcon },
  { label: "Inventory", route: "/inventory", icon: inventoryIcon },
  // ... additional authenticated routes
];
```

### Complex Form Management
- **Multi-step Forms**: Inventory and menu item creation with image preview
- **Real-time Validation**: Client-side validation with immediate feedback
- **Dynamic Field Updates**: Conditional form fields based on user input

### State Synchronization
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates with API confirmation
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful error handling with state rollback
- **Cache Management**: Local state updates after successful API operations

## üîê Authentication Flow

1. **Login Process**: Credential submission with JWT extraction from headers
2. **Token Management**: Automatic localStorage persistence with decode validation
3. **Route Protection**: Conditional rendering based on authentication state
4. **Session Persistence**: Automatic token validation on application load

## üìä Data Management Patterns

### API Integration
```jsx
// Standardized API communication pattern
const fetchUserInventory = async (token, userId) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/inventory/user/${userId}`, {
      method: "GET",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${token}`,
      },
    });
    // Error handling and data processing
  } catch (error) {
    // Toast notification with context-specific messaging
  }
};
```

### Real-time Updates
- **Immediate Feedback**: Toast notifications for all user actions
- **Optimistic Rendering**: UI updates before API confirmation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states with user-friendly messages
